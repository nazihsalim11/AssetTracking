/**
 * Notification templates.
 *
 * One entry per event type, rendering the same event for all three channels so the
 * wording cannot drift between them. Each template returns:
 *
 *   type    - severity, drives the in-app dot colour ('info' | 'warning' | 'error')
 *   subject - email subject line
 *   inApp   - short text for the bell popover
 *   email   - full body
 *   sms     - terse body; SMS is billed per 160 characters, so keep it tight
 *
 * `ctx` is the event payload assembled by the caller.
