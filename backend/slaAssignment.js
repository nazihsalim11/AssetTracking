/**
 * Technician auto-assignment. A policy can nominate a strategy; this module turns that
 * into a concrete agent:
 *
 *   least_loaded  — the eligible agent with the fewest open tickets (ties broken by id).
 *   round_robin   — the eligible agent who was least-recently handed a ticket, which
 *                   spreads new work evenly without needing a stored pointer.
 *
 * "Eligible" means an active, non-Employee user, preferring those in the ticket's
 * department and falling back to the whole pool if the department has no agent — the
 * same rule the assignee picker uses in the UI.
